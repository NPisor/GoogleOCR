# GoogleOCR

GoogleOCR is a program created for a college course to take in a handwritten message and translate the characters between multiple languages to hide them.  It uses Google Vision OCR
along with OpenCV to handle the input of the images, convert the text, and save and display the final result.

You will need the GoogleAuth.json file from an account created with Google Vision and add it to the local directory.
